        <h2 className="service-subtitle">How to Care for Koi Fish</h2>
        <p className="service-description">
          Caring for Koi fish requires an ideal environment and a proper diet. One of the most critical factors in Koi fish care is water quality. The water should maintain a stable pH level and temperature to ensure the fish's healthy growth. Koi fish thrive in water with a pH level of 7 to 7.5 and a temperature of 15°C to 25°C.
        </p>
        <p className="service-description">
          A water filtration system is essential. Filtration helps remove impurities, bacteria, and pollutants, ensuring a clean and safe environment for the fish. If the pond water becomes polluted, the fish may become ill or die prematurely. Regular water changes and quality checks are crucial for maintaining a healthy habitat.
        </p>
        <p className="service-description">
          Another factor is the diet of Koi fish. They need a diverse and nutritious diet, including specialized Koi food containing proteins, vitamins, and essential minerals. Avoid overfeeding, as it can pollute the pond water.
